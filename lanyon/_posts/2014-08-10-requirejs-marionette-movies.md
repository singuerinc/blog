Long time ago I had have a catalog with all my movies... it was impossible to keep track of all of them I've purchased.<br/>
Yesterday I found that "The Movie DB" is one of the best options to search movies info. So, I've made a quick example of how to use it, and like in the last 3 apps I've used <a href="http://requirejs.org" target="_blank">RequireJS</a> and <a href="http://marionettejs.com/">Marionette.js</a>.

You could find the source at <a href="https://github.com/singuerinc/blog/tree/master/lanyon/code/labs/require-marionette-movies" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
