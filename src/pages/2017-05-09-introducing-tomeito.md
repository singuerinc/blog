Tomeito is another pomodoro timer app for macOS.

What's the difference between this one and other timers apps:

- Minimal interface
- Simple to use

> Important: This is a free app. I'm not paying â‚¬99 to Apple to have a certified app. So expect a warning when you install it.

## Idle

If a pomodoro/break is not started or is ended, the app is in idle state.

## Regular pomodoro (25 minutes)

After clicking play in idle state a pomodoro timer is started.  
Each pomodoro consist in a timer of 25 minutes. You can skip or reset them at any time.

## Short Break (5 minutes)

## Long Break (15 minutes)

## Settings

From the settings you can control how the app behaves:

- Tick Sound: Actives or disactivates the tic tac sound
- Auto Play: If enabled, pomodori and breaks starts automatically
- On Top: If active, the app remains on top of other windows
