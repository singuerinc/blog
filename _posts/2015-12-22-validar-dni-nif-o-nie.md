Since this is my most viewed post I wanted to update a bit and make it more "reactive".  
If you want to generate some valid NIF or NIE for testing, you could use the following tool:

<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/singuerinc/n5w2nsa9/14/embed/"></script>

But, if what you want is validate some DNI you should use this little function I've made some time ago. I've used on this demo Vue.js, a new Javascript library that allows me to make a quick _reactive_ prototype:

<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/singuerinc/5bwL1r9n/9/embed/"></script>
